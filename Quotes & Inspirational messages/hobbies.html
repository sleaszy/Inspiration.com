Words can help you stay grounded, release tension, and relax so use them to explore your creativity and release anxiety and tension.

<li><strong>LEARN A NEW LANGUAGE</strong></li>
<p>Whether musical scales or a completely new language, diving head first into new ways of communicating can help relieve depression and anxiety. We recommend choosing one: A new instrument or a new language. Create reasonable milestones for yourself to reach and start learning. There are plenty of free and cheap apps and instructional videos available to get you started, and before you know it, youâ€™re too busy learning how to play your favourite song on the guitar or hold a conversation in French to focus on the things making you anxious. Just donâ€™t put too much pressure on yourself! Learning a new language can be an incredibly useful hobby, but can feel stressful if you put a high expectation on yourself to learn quickly.
</p>
<li><strong>JOURNAL DAILY</strong></li>
<p>Think of it as writing your memoir, an account of your life. Begin each entry with a list of things youâ€™re grateful for since your last entry, then start writing about your life or just your day. This process can be extremely cathartic and help uncover patterns in your life that have led to anxiety and depression; once you understand the cause of your anxious thoughts, itâ€™s easier to combat them. Keep your journal with you in case thereâ€™s something you want to make a note of to write about later.
</p>
<li><strong>LISTEN TO SOME SOOTHING MUSIC</strong></li>
<p>Sometimes listeining to some soothing music, the kind of music that uplifts your mood and soul
that is what you should listen to.</p>
<li><strong>TAKING CARE OF TREES</strong></li>
<p>Thereâ€™s nothing like watching and nurturing plants to encourage optimism and mental health. Since youâ€™ll have something to look forward to in each season, gardening can create joy and break cycles of anxiety. It can also help you clear your mind, especially after difficult days.

</p>
<li><strong>VOLUNTEER IN SOMETHING GOOD</strong></li>
<p>Often, we feel anxious after a stressful situation causing us to overthink our lives, then we get stuck in our own heads. To help get yourself away from anxious thoughts, it helps to focus on other people or acts of service. Do a Google search of nonprofit organizations in your community, find a cause that resonates with you, and connect with them to volunteer. Helping other people or even animals in need can help you put your situation into better perspective and help you feel more peaceful, content, and empowered to address things that seemed overwhelming before.
